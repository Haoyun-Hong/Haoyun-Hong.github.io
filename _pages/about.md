Hi! Iâ€™m **Haoyun (Elizabeth) Hong**, a PhD student in **Biomedical and Health Informatics** at University of Washington, Seattle.  
I earned my **B.A. in Data Science** from UC Berkeley (2018â€“2022) and worked as a data scientist **Data Scientist / Statistical Analyst** at the **American Heart Association** from 2022 to 2025. 

# Selected Research Projects  
### Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)  
A suite of in-patient quality improvement registries by the American Heart Assocaiton to improve treatment and outcomes.

In collaboration with clinical researchers, We have investigated various aspects of STEMI care over the years including: 

- **Race-Based Differences in STEMI Process Metrics and Mortality (2015â€“2021)**  
  *Published in Circulation (IF: 37.8).*  

- **Site-level variability in STEMI care**
  *JAMA Cardiology (IF: 14.7)*

- **Treatment Time and In-Hospital Mortality in STEMI Patients (2018â€“2021)**  
  *Published in JAMA (IF: 120.7).*
